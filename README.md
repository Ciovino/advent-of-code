# Advent of Code - Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenge.

## About Advent of Code
The **Advent of Code** (AoC) is a series of short programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. The event provides a festive, story-driven way to sharpen algorithmic thinking and coding skills.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by year. Each year's folder contains the solutions scripts for the corresponding puzzles.

```sh
├── 2025/             # Current Year
│   ├── day01.py
│   ├── day02.py
│   └── ...
├── 2024/             # Past Edition Solutions
│   ├── day01.py
│   └── ...
├── data/
│   ├── 2025_01.in    # Input data
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## Test the code
To run a solution, navigate to the respective year and day folder, and execute the Python file.

Example: To run the Day 1 solution for 2025: `python 2025/day01.py`

You can also change the input data by updating the corresponding file in the `data` folder. This why you can also test the solution for the input you have downloaded.
